# CHI Software test task Level 1. Senior level

### Implementation details:

- Showing a fragment on top of an Activity with content didn't seem like a good
  idea, so MainActivity's content was moved to the MainFragment, to be able to
  easily replace it with the CountingFragment.
- There were issues with adding a back button to the Toolbar, and the resulting
  button turned out to be black, instead of white. Due to time constraints I
  decided to not try to fix it.
